    # refactoring means to
    # improve the structure of existing code without changing its external behavior
    # This helps to enhance readabiliy, maintainability, and efficiency.




    # Problem Set 1: Indexing and Slicing Strings
    # Basic Indexing:
    # Given the string magic = 'abracadabra',
    # a. Retrieve the 5th character.
    phrase1="abracadabra"
    print(phrase1[4])
    # b. Retrieve the second to last character. 
    print(phrase1[-2])
    # c. Find the first occurrence of the letter 'c'.
    letter_to_find = "c"
    print(phrase1.find(letter_to_find))
